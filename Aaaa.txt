// Create a responsive and modern personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS preferred), and JavaScript (React optional).
// The site should showcase past coding projects and achievements in a visually impressive, futuristic "Cyberpunk" or "Techno-Cyber" style.
// It will be used for a university application to study Computer Science, so the focus should be on clarity, creativity, and technical presentation.
// The site should have a dark theme with neon/glow accents (blue, purple, pink, green), animated background elements (like matrix lines or cyber grid), and sleek transitions.
// Required sections: 
// 1. Hero section with my name "Sakdithat", age "18", and a short intro like "Aspiring Computer Scientist with a passion for coding and creating innovative projects".
// 2. Projects section: cards or grid displaying 3–6 projects with title, tech stack (icons or badges), description, and GitHub link.
// 3. About Me: a short paragraph about my passion in programming and interest in computer science.
// 4. Skills: list of programming languages and tools (e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, Git, etc.) – ideally with icons.
// 5. Contact: simple contact form or email/social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub).
// Use smooth animations (Framer Motion or CSS transitions), interactive hover effects, and responsive layout (desktop/tablet/mobile).
// Use semantic HTML5 tags, accessibility best practices (like alt text, labels), and clean code structure.
// If using React, break down components by section (e.g., Header, Hero, Projects, About, Skills, Footer).
// Bonus: add a glowing cyber-style cursor and subtle background music toggle (optional).
// Target audience: university admission team evaluating my passion and skill in programming.
